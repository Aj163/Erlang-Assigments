# ASSIGNMENT 2

## Question 1

- qsort() 			- Function that accepts a list, and sorts it using the quick sort algorithm.

- isort() 			- Function that accepts a list, and sorts it using the - - insertion sort algorithm.
- insertion_sort() 	- Inserting first element the given list, into a new sorted list recursively.
- insert() 			- Inserting an element into the right place of the sorted list.

- bsort() 			- Function that accepts a list, and sorts it using the bubble sort algorithm.
- biggestToRightEnd() - Pushes the largest element to the right extreme of the list.

- ssort() 			- Function that accepts a list, and sorts it using the selection sort algorithm.
- selection_sort() 	- Recursively pops the max element from List and push into the beginning of sorted list.
- max_elem() 			- Finds largest element in the list.

- msort() 			- Function that accepts a list, and sorts it using the merge sort algorithm.
- merge() 			- Merges 2 sorted lists, such that the merged list is also sorted.


Time taken by algorithms to sort lists of various sizes, randomly generated:

## Question 2

- unique() -  Takes a list as a parameter and returns the unique itemsof the list as a new list.

## Question 3

- replicate() - 	Takes two parameters n and x and returns a list containing the value x, n times.
- Example replicate(5,2) => [2,2,2,2,2]

## Question 4

- reverse() - Reverses the contents of an input list.

## Question 5

- zip() -	Takes two lists as parameters and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the ith element from each of the input lists. The returned listis truncated in length to the length of the shortest argument sequence.
- Example â€“ zip [1,2,3,4,5] [7,8,9] => [(1,7), (2,8), (3,9)]

## Question 6

- fibonacci(i) - Calculates the ith fibonacci number of the sequence using recursion.
- fibo() - Calls fib() function.
- fib() - Calculates the ith fibonacci number of the sequence using tail recursion.

Time taken by fibonacci() - Using Recursion, to compute the Nth fibonacci number.
